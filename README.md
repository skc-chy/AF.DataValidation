This component provides attribute-based server-side data validation function on DTO object.
The unique feature of this component is it allow data validation per operation. i.e., Add/Update.
When we are using common data entity for multiple operations, like add, update or delete then one specific field which is mandatory for one operation may not be mandatory for other operation. This package helps to overcome this problem by accepting operation type while validating the entity.
